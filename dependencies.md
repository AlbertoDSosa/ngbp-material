# Dependencies

## Development dependencies 

- [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - Is a JavaScript task runner. Why use a task runner?
In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it through a Gruntfile, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

## Application dependencies

- [angular](https://angularjs.org/) - HTML enhanced for web apps! Why AngularJS? HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
- [angular-material](https://material.angularjs.org) - The Angular Material project is an implementation of Material Design in Angular.js. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system.
- [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) - AngularUI Router is a routing framework for AngularJS, which allows you to organize the parts of your interface into a state machine. Unlike the $route service in the Angular ngRoute module, which is organized around URL routes, UI-Router is organized around states, which may optionally have routes, as well as other behavior, attached.
States are bound to named, nested and parallel views, allowing you to powerfully manage your application's interface.
- [material-design-icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons) - Material design icons are the official icon set from Google that are designed under the material design guidelines.
